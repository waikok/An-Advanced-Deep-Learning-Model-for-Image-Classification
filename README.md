# Project Title: An-Advanced-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Image-Classification

This project is designed to perform image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks.  This is because concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if the crack is not being identified quickly and repaired.  This project is trained and tested using 40,000 images with MobileNetV3Large transfer learning to achieve high accuracy and low loss rate.
